### **The _todo-js_ project is a simple web application that allows users to create and manage their to-do lists. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.**
&nbsp;
> 1. The HTML file contains the basic structure of the web page, including the header, input field, and list of tasks.
> 2. The CSS file contains the styling for the web page, including the font size, color scheme, and layout.
> 3. The JavaScript file contains the logic for adding new tasks to the list, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks from the list.
> 4. The project uses local storage to store the userâ€™s to-do list so that it persists even after the user closes their browser.
